# Here's a mindbender for you:

a = 10
b = 20
a = b
print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")

# @TASK: What does that output? And why? Take a guess, then
# run the code and see.

# Was it what you expected?

# Answer: `a` is 20 and `b` is 20. I guessed it right. a is 20 because it was reassigned on line 7 to the value of b, which was 20.

# Try to puzzle it out, and then move on to
# 020_state_tables.py
